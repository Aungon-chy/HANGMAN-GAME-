# HANGMAN-GAME-
Hangman is a classic word-guessing game where players try to guess a hidden word by suggesting letters. Each wrong guess adds a part to a stick figure. The game ends when the word is guessed or the figure is complete. It's fun, educational, and helps improve vocabulary. Hangman is popular both on paper and in digital formats.
